## Overview

**Project Title**:  
E-Commerce Sales Analysis

**Project Description**:  
This project analyzes a sample dataset of Amazon unlocked mobile phone reviews. The goal is to extract meaningful insights such as product ratings, pricing trends, customer sentiment, and product popularity using Python and the Pandas library.

**Project Goals**:  
* Load and clean the data
* Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Extract statistics like average rating, most reviewed brands, and high-rated products
* Practice using Pandas for real-world data analysis
